# Personal Website

Hello and welcome to my personal website!  It acts as a nice way for me to display my projects and experiments in an easily accessible and consolidated format.  The format of this site has been based on a template created by [@arifszn](https://github.com/arifszn) called [GitProfile](https://github.com/arifszn/gitprofile).
